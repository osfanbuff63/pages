So I've done a thing! My new Minecraft note block song is out, published on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6avoa8huOOo) and [PeerTube](https://video.mycrowd.ca/w/vzPqq4Qq1A2GtBzLsLbDZo)

Here's some more downloads, while I try to think of what else to put here:

- [NBS file](/files/mii_channel.nbs) - used for Note Block Studio
- [MP3](/files/mii_channel.mp3) - raw file
- [Minecraft data pack](/files/mii_channel.zip) - requires [this resource pack](https://github.com/OpenNBS/OpenNoteBlockStudio/raw/master/datafiles/Data/extranotes.zip), then once you install it you can run `/function osfanbuff63:songs/mii_channel/play` to play it.
