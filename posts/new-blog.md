After what felt like 15 years, I finally fixed my website. Well - sorta.

This blog has been redone using [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev). In addition, the source code is now hosted on [Codeberg](https://codeberg.org/osfanbuff63/pages) and this website is hosted by [Codeberg Pages](https://codeberg.page).

There'll be more in the next few days possibly, but not yet.
